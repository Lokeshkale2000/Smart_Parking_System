Smart Parking System 

Introduction
I am excited to introduce my project, the Smart Parking System, designed to solve the parking issues faced by many in our urban areas. This application utilizes modern web technologies to provide an efficient parking management solution.

Features
1. Multi-Storied Parking
Our system efficiently manages multi-storied parking lots. Each floor contains multiple parking slots for cars and bikes.

2. Real-time Status Visualization
Users can easily view the current status of each floor through an intuitive visual representation. This helps users quickly identify available parking spaces.

3. Parking Availability Check
The app enables users to check the availability of parking spaces for bikes and cars in real-time.

4. Secure and Persistent Data Storage
The application securely stores data using local storage. This ensures that the parking data remains intact even after closing the browser.

5. Responsive Design
The app is fully responsive, allowing users to access it seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
